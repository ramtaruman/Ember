# Ember

A minimalist, tiny little card game.

## The Game

Ember is a simple, luck-based digital card game where you try to predict the properties of a randomly drawn playing card from a standard 52-card deck.

Each turn a new random card is generated, independent of the previous turns, and you earn points by accurately predicting its colour, its suit, and its rank.

### Scoring System
- **Color:** +1 point 
- **Suit:** +2 points 
- **Rank:** +6 points
