# Ember

A minimalist, tiny little card game.

## The Game

Ember is a simple, luck-based digital card game where you try to predict the properties of a randomly drawn playing card from a standard 52-card deck.

Each turn a new random card is generated, independent of the previous turns, and you earn points by accurately predicting its colour, its suit, and its rank.

### Scoring System
- **Color:** +1 point 
- **Suit:** +2 points 
- **Rank:** +6 points 

*Note: Selecting all options within a category voids it and awards 0 points for that category.*

### Features
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Stripped back, dark, typography-first UI.
- **Single Player:** Play rounds of 5, 10, 20, or a custom number of turns.
- **Multiplayer:** Play locally with up to 8 players via rotating turns.
- **Fluid UI:** Subtle reveal animations, dynamic HUDs, and end-of-game confetti feedback.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Pure vanilla JavaScript and CSS variables.
